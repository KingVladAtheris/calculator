A simple calculator. <br>
Result operation displays on screen after operator(+, -, /, *, =) is pressed a second, third, etc. time. <br>
Special operators(+/- and %) update display but keep previous operation structure, e.g.:<br>
3 + 9 % = will output 3.09<br>
9 + 7 +/- = will output 2<br>
AC button clears all data and outputs 0<br>
Maximum digits per number is 9.<br>
If result exceeds maximum space, result is converted to scientific notation using exponent e, where e +/-n is e to the power of +/-n
